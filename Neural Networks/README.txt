Here I have some Neural Networks which I've implemented from scratch with Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI in Coursera Plataform.

Important: I'm working in a way that you can interact with the notebook with my data directly from google colab and synchronized with GitHub to avoid to download and run local. Soon, with one click, you will be able to interact directly from colab. While it is not ready, feel free to download the whole file containing the data and notebook. (It just applies in files that github can't open with raw e.g h5 extension files. With CSVs or notebooks which are not necessary data e.g code only, demonstrations, you can run directly in colab)

Some observations:

1 - I WILL NOT go deeper in some mathematical concepts as Linear Algebra and Calculus, just provide some insights and maybe some links;
2 - I WILL NOT go deeper in coding concepts, just explain what I am doing assuming that YOU have the coding background;
3 - Please, check 'Vectorization' for some explanation about why I am using NumPy.

Enjoy! =D
