Here I have some Neural Networks which I've implemented from scratch with Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI in Coursera Plataform.

Some observations:

1 - I WILL NOT go deeper in some mathematical concepts, just provide some links or insights;
2 - I WILL NOT go deeper in coding concepts, just explain what I am doing assuming that YOU have the coding background;
3 - Please, check 'Vectorization' for some explanation about why I am using NumPy.

Enjoy! =D
