# Data-Science-and-AI
Here is where I put my projects with Data Science and Artificial Intelligence to demonstrate my skills.

As my bio says, I'm a Intern Data Scientist at IBM and this repository is for demonstrate my skills in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Statistics. I also 
love to deal with Quantum Computing. That's me.

Enjoy :D
